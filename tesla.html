								<h3>Why did I undertake this project?</h3>
								<p>Apart from programming, finance is another area that I am very interested in.
                  I am personally invested in various different companies and keeping on top of them every day can be challenging.
                  As such, I created this project so that at the end of every trading session, you will receive a text message if Tesla's stock price has changed by 3% or more.
                  As well as that, you'll also receive the top three headlines associated with Tesla, so that you can read exactly why the stock price has changed.
								</p>
								<h3>How does it work?</h3>
								<p>I used various API's to gain all the relevant information I required.
                  For example, I used the Alphavantage API to gain the stock price information, The news API to gain information surrounding the company and also Twilio API to send a text message.
								</p>
								<h3>Technicals</h3>
								<p>I created a free Twilio account where I was able to use their API service to send myself a text message if Tesla stock price changed by 3% or more.
                  I used the Python 'request' module to get information from various websites in the form of a JSON.
                  I would then store the information I required in a variable and use this through out my programme
